The mythical 'Australia weather App' that automates retrieving weather data. Finally getting around to making it.

### 16/03/2021
Phase 1: getting a proof-of-concept Ruby script up to make sure the HTTP requests/responses are alright and perform diagnostics.

(**Phase 1 Complete**: Unit tests/etc pending(?).)

Phase 2: porting the Ruby script logic to a standalone R function that can be used to retrieve the weather data (using the API/HTTP calls) and store it in a data frame. Ancillary functions for plotting/saving the data as necessary.

Phase 3: construction of the Shiny App according to the plan (see uploaded PDF).
