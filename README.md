The mythical 'Australia weather App' that automates retrieving weather data. Finally getting around to finishing it.

### 16/03/2021
Phase 1: getting a proof-of-concept Ruby script up to make sure the HTTP requests/responses are alright and perform diagnostics.

(**Phase 1 Complete**: Unit tests/etc pending(?).)

### 13/04/2021
Reformulated as **wVane**. The Ruby version has been refactored as a testable module and unit tests have been written. A MVP for the R package has been written (yet to be updated, using the Ruby version as a stencil), and the Shiny App is written and functional. Pending documentation, CSS-prettying and some unit/Shiny tests.
